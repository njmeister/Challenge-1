# UTA Coding Bootcamp Challenge 1

## Description

This is my submission for the first challenge in the UTA/EdX Coding Bootcamp. The goal of this challenge was to improve the accessibility of a sample website using HTML and CSS.
To do so, I changed the code's HTML div tags to appropriate semantic tags, added alt text for the images, and simplified the CSS code to eliminate redundancies and increase readability.



## Installation

N/A



## Usage

The website presents information about a fictional SEO company. Using DevTools, you can observe the semantic code I have employed.
